Welcome to gettsim's documentation!
===================================

GETTSIM aims at providing a depiction of the German Taxes and Transfers System that is
usable across a wide range of research applications, ranging from highly complex dynamic
programming models to extremely detailed microsimulation studies.

GETTSIM is implemented in Python and Numba, thereby achieving both flexibility and
speed. All features are extensively tested.

The current version is usable, but probably only by the initiated. Please get in touch
(via an issue or emailing `Hans-Martin von Gaudecker
<https://www.iza.org/de/people/fellows/4238/hans-martin-von-gaudecker>`_) if you want to
use it already, else keep an eye out for what there is to come!
