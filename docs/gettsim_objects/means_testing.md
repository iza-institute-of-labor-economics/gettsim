# Assets considered for means testing

The table below gives an overview of all tangible and intangible assets which are
considered when performing means for several transfers. A cross indicates that the asset
class is not considered and, hence, deducted from the overall assets of a household.

This documentation shall help to understand the composition of the

{ref}`basic input variable <input_variables>`

'vermögen_bedürft_bg'. Despite small differences over the transfers, we decided, for
now, to require only one wealth variable as input and use it for all transfers.

```{note}
ALGII = Grundsicherung für Arbeitslose

GSA/E = Grundsicherung im Alter/ bei Erwerbsminderung

WoGe = Wohngeld

KiZu = Kinderzuschlag

HC = hardship case
(Asset class is not considered if it would constitute a particular hardship for that person, see § 90 Abs.3 SGBXII [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_12/\_\_90.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_12/__90.html))
