# Relevant unit concepts

This document describes the concepts of units and intra-personal relationships that are
present in GETTSIM for the specific taxes and transfers. While some transfers are
calculated on the unit level (e.g. Bürgergeld), others arise from relationships between
individuals (e.g. Kindergeld).

If transfers are calculated on the unit level, the unit is specified under "Aggregation
unit". Under "Pointers", we describe the pointer columns (columns that contain the
`p_id` of another individual) that are used to i) determine endogenous units (like
`bg_id`, `sn_id`,...) and/or ii) connect individuals because their relationship makes
them eligible for some transfer (i.e. parent-child relationships create eligibility for
child allowances).

The units are:

| Unit                             | ID      | Description                                                                                                                                                                     | Endogenous |

| Ehepartner                       | ehe_id  | Couples that are either married or in a civil union.                                                                                                                            | yes        |

> gekennzeichnet, dass ihre Mitglieder nicht nur vorübergehend in einer Wohnung
> zusammenleben, sondern einen gemeinsamen Haushalt in der Weise führen, dass sie „aus
> einem Topf“ wirtschaften. Das gemeinsame Wirtschaften geht über die gemeinsame Nutzung
> von Bad, Küche und ggf. Gemeinschaftsräumen sowie über einen gemeinsam organisierten
> Einkauf über eine Gemeinschaftskasse, wie dies regelmäßig in Wohngemeinschaften
> organisiert ist, hinaus.

#### Aggregation unit

- Not implemented yet. The current `eg_id` is not sufficient as it doesn't include
  children (it follows the SGB II definition).
- Potentially, `bg_id` could be used as the aggregation unit.

## Wohngeld

#### Description

- Household (§5 WoGG)
  - Applicant
  - Spouse / registered partner / life partner (as long as in same household)
  - Parents (incl. step-, foster- and in-laws) (as long as in same household)
  - Children (incl. step-, foster- and adopted children) (as long as in same household)
  - "Einstandspartner": non-relatives living in the same household and sharing
    responsibility for each other (e.g. couples that are not married or in a civil
    union) (as long as in same household)
    - A community of responsibility or joint liability is regulated in § 7 Abs. 3a SGB
      II according to which at least one of the following conditions must be met
      - if partners live together for longer than 1 year
      - if partners live together with a child
      - if children or relatives are cared for or looked after in the household (not
        only occasionally)
      - if partners are mutually authorized to dispose of income and assets
    - The prerequisite for all household members is that they live with the applicant
      live in a shared apartment or house and are also registered there.
  - Other relatives
- wohngeldrechtlicher Teilhaushalt: Level at which the transfer is paid out. A household
  consists of at most one wohngeldrechtlicher Teilhaushalt with positive Wohngeld
  transfer and may consist of several additional Bedarfsgemeinschaften.
  - Wohngeld has priority over SGB II transfers. The Vorrangprüfung decides which
    Bedarfsgemeinschaft gets Wohngeld and which gets SGB II.
  - If no or all household members receive Bürgergeld instead of an SGB II transfer, the
    wohngeldrechtlicher Teilhaushalt equals the Haushalt, i.e. `wthh_id = hh_id`.
  - Households that consist of at least one Bedarfsgemeinschaft and one
    wohngeldrechtlicher Teilhaushalt are called "Mischhaushalte".

#### Aggregation unit

- `wthh_id` (endogenous)

#### Pointers

- `hh_id`, `p_id_einstandspartner`, `p_id_elternteil_1`, `p_id_elternteil_2` (exogenous)

### Kinderwohngeld

#### Description

- Children that are part of the Bedarfsgemeinschaft of their parents can receive
  Wohngeld to drop out of the Bedarfsgemeinschaft ("Kinderwohngeld")
- Only possible if the child can cover its needs with the Wohngeld transfer
- Does not happen automatically, but upon request by the parents
- Not implemented yet.

## Limitations

- Within a Wohngeldhaushalt, no distinction can be made between persons without
  Einstandsverpflichtung according to SGB II or SGB XII and those with
  Einstandsverpflichtung

- Can only show the two extreme cases

  1. all non-vertical or partner relationships not a candidate for Haushaltsgemeinschaft
     according to SGB II / SGB XII
  1. all non-vertical or partner relationships are candidates for Haushaltsgemeinschaft
     according to SGB II / SGB XII

  Typically, 1. will be the solution (hurdles for joint economic activity are high).

- An alternative would be another ID variable that specifies Einstandsgemeinschaft
  according to SGB II and SGB XII.

### Parts of the data not available

- Adult children exist, but not in the dataset
- Spouse that should pay child support is not in the dataset

Solution:

Add support for missing IDs in the data. Missing IDs are represented by negative IDs
(exact value doesn't matter for now).
