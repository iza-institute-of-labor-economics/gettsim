GETTSIM Enhancement Protocols
=============================

Setting up GETTSIM and making major changes is done via the process of GETTSIM
Enhancement Protocols, short GEPs. They serve the purpose of summarising discussions
that may happen in chats, issues, pull requests, in person, or by any other means. They
describe the basis for GETTSIM's architecture and set a process for adopting major
changes (or not).

These GEPs are currently in place:
