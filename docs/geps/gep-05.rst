Abstract
--------

This GEP describes the implementation of optional rounding of variables in GETTSIM.


Motivation and Scope
--------------------

For several taxes and transfers, German law specifies that these be rounded in specific
ways. This leads to different use cases for GETTSIM.

1. Some applications require the exact, rounded, amount as specified in the law. This
   is also helpful for creating test cases.
2. Other applications benefit if functions are mostly smooth and the non-rounding error
   relative to the law does not matter much.

GETTSIM's default will be 1. This document describes how we support both use cases.


Implementation
--------------

GETTSIM allows for optional rounding of functions' results. Rounding parameters are
specified in the ``.yaml``-files. The following goes through the details using an
example from the basic pension allowance (Grundrente).

The law on the public pension insurance specifies that the maximum possible
Grundrentenzuschlag ``grundr_zuschlag_höchstwert_m`` be rounded to the nearest
fourth decimal point (§76g SGB VI: Zuschlag an Entgeltpunkten für langjährige
Versicherung). The example below contains GETTSIM's encoding of this fact.

The snippet is taken from ``ges_rente.yaml``, which contains the following
code:

.. code-block:: yaml

    rounding:
      grundr_zuschlag_höchstwert_m:
        2020-01-01:
          base: 0.0001
          direction: nearest
          reference: §76g SGB VI Abs. 4 Nr. 4

The specification of the rounding parameters starts with the key ``rounding`` at
the outermost level of indentation. The keys are names of functions.

At the next level, the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` key(s) indicate when rounding was
introduced and/or changed. This is done in in the same way as for other policy
parameters, see in :ref:`gep-3`. Those ``YYYY-MM-DD`` key(s) are
associated with a dictionary containing the following elements:

- The parameter ``base`` determines the base to which the variables is rounded.
  It has to be a floating point number.
- The parameter ``direction`` has to be one of ``up``, ``down``, or ``nearest``.
- The ``reference`` must contain the reference to the law, which specifies the
  rounding.

In the same way as other policy parameters, the rounding parameters become part
of the dictionary ``policy_params``.

A function to be rounded must be decorated with ``add_rounding_spec``. This decorator
indicates that the output should potentially be rounded. ``add_rounding_spec`` takes
one required argument: ``params_key`` points to the key of the policy parameters
dictionary containing the rounding parameters relating to the function that is
decorated. In the above example, the rounding specification for
``grundr_zuschlag_höchstwert_m`` will be found in ``policy_params["ges_rente"]``
after ``set_up_policy_environment()`` has been called (since it was specified in
``ges_rente.yaml``). Hence, the ``params_key`` argument of ``add_rounding_spec`` has
to be ``"ges_rente"``:

.. code-block:: python

    @add_rounding_spec(params_key="ges_rente")
    def grundr_zuschlag_höchstwert_m(grundr_zeiten: IntSeries) -> FloatSeries:
        ...
        return out

The decorator adds the attribute ``__rounding_params_key__`` to the function. When
calling ``compute_taxes_and_transfers`` with ``rounding=True``, GETTSIM will
look for a key ``"rounding"`` in ``policy_params["params_key"]`` and
within that, for another key containing the decorated function's name (here:
``"grundr_zuschlag_höchstwert_m"``). That is, by the machinery outlined in
:ref:`gep-3`, the following indexing of the ``policy_params`` dictionary

.. code-block:: python

    policy_params["ges_rente"]["rounding"]["grundr_zuschlag_höchstwert_m"]

needs to be possible and yield the ``"base"`` and ``"direction"`` keys as
described above.

Note that GETTSIM only allows for optional rounding of functions' results. In
case one is tempted to write a function requiring an intermediate variable to be
rounded, the function should be split up so that another function returns the
quantity to be rounded.

Error handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case a function has a ``__rounding_params_key__``, but the respective parameters are
missing in ``policy_params``, an error is raised.

Note that if the results have to be rounded in some years, but not in others (e.g.
after a policy reform) the rounding parameters (both ``"base"`` and ``"direction"``)
must be set to ``None``. This allows that the rounding parameters are found and no error
is raised, but still no rounding is applied.

In case rounding parameters are specified and the function does not have
a ``__rounding_params_key__`` attribute, execution will not
lead to an error. This will never happen in the GETTSIM
codebase, however, due to a suitable test.

User-specified rounding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user wants to change rounding of a specified function, she will need to adjust the
rounding parameters in ``policy_params``.

Suppose one would like to specify a reform in which ``grundr_zuschlag_höchstwert_m`` is
rounded to the next-lowest fourth decimal point instead of to the nearest. In that
case, the rounding parameters will need to be changed as follows

.. code-block:: python

       policy_params["ges_rente"]["rounding"]["grundr_zuschlag_höchstwert_m"][
           "direction"
       ] = "down"

This will be done after the policy environment has been set up and it is exactly the
same as for other parameters of the taxes and transfers system, see :ref:gep-3.

If a user would like to add user-written functions which should be rounded, she will
need to decorate the respective functions with ``add_rounding_spec`` and adjust
``policy_params`` accordingly.



Advantages of this implementation
---------------------------------

This implementation was chosen over alternatives (e.g., specifying the rounding
parameters in the ``.py`` files directly) for the following reason:

- How a variable is rounded is a feature of the taxes and transfers system.
  Hence, the best place to define it is alongside its other features.
- Rounding parameters might change over time. In this case, the rounding
  parameters for each period can be specified in the parameter file using a
  well-established machinery.
- Optional rounding can be easily specified for user-written functions.
- At the definition of a function, it is clearly visible whether it is
  optionally rounded and where the rounding parameters are found.
