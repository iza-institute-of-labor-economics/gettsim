Abstract
--------

This GEP lays out how GETTSIM stores the user-provided data (be it from the SOEP, EVS,
example individuals, ...) and passes it around to the functions calculating taxes and
transfers.

Data will be stored as a collection of 1-d arrays, each of which corresponds to a column
in the data provided by the user (if it comes in the form of a DataFrame) or calculated
by GETTSIM. All these arrays have the same length. This length corresponds to the number
of individuals. Functions operate on a single row of data. 

If a column name is ``[x]_id`` with `x` :math:`\in \{` ``hh``, ``tu`` :math:`\}`, it
will be the same for all households, tax units, or any other grouping of individuals
specified in :ref:`GEP 1 <gep-1-column-names>`.

Any other column name ending in ``_id`` indicates a link to a different individual
(e.g., child-parent relations could be ``parent_0_ind_id``, ``parent_1_ind_id``;
receiver of child benefits would be ``kindergeldempf_id``).


Motivation and Scope
--------------------

Taxes and transfers are calculated at different levels of aggregation: Individuals,
couples, families, households. Sometimes, relations between individuals are important:
parents and children, payors/receivers of alimony payments, which parent receives the
`kindergeld` payments, etc..

Potentially, there are many ways of storing these data: Long form, wide form,
collections of tables adhering to :ref:`normal forms
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization>`, N-dimensional arrays, etc.. As
usual, everything involves trade-offs, for example:

- Normal forms require many merge / join operations, which the tools we are using are
  not optimised for.
- One N-dimensional array is not possible because the aggregation dimensions are not
  necessarily nested
- Almost all functions are much easier to implement when working with a single row.
  This is most important for the typical user and increasing the number of developers.
- Modern tools for vectorization (e.g., Jax) scale best when working with
  single rows of data.

  Aggregation to groups of individuals (households, tax units) or referencing data from
  other rows (parents, receiver of child benefits) is not trivial with these tools.


Usage and Impact
----------------

This is primarily internal, i.e., only relevant for developers as the highest-level
interface can be easily adjusted. The default way to receive data will be one Pandas
DataFrame.

Users are affected only via the interface of lower-level functions. Under the proposed
implementation, they will always work on single rows of data. Many alternatives would
require users to write vectorised code, making filtering operations more cumbersome. For
aggregation or referencing other individuals' data, GETTSIM will provide functions that
allow abstracting from implementation details, see :ref:`below
<gep-2-aggregation-functions>`.


Detailed description
--------------------

The following discussion assumes that data is passed in as a Pandas DataFrame. It will
be possible to pass data directly in the form that GETTSIM requires it internally. In
that case, only the relevant steps apply.

- GETTSIM will first make a check that all identifiers pointing to other individuals
  (e.g., `kindergeldempf_id`) are valid.

- GETTSIM will then create internal identifiers for individuals, households, and tax
  units. GETTSIM will also generate appropriate columns with identifiers pointing
  to other individuals. Columns with the original values are stored. 

  All internal identifiers are integers starting at 0 and counting in increments of 1.
  For individuals, they are sorted, implying they can be used to index into the arrays.
  It also means that identifiers pointing to other individuals can be used directly for
  indexing.

  Because other units of aggregation are not necessarily nested, they cannot be sorted
  in general. In case users' data allow it, they will be able to provide a
  `data_is_sorted` flag, which defaults to `False`.

- The core of GETTSIM then works with a collection of 1-d arrays, all of which have the
  same length as the number of individuals. 
  
  These arrays form the nodes of its DAG computation engine (see :ref:`GEP 4
  <gep-4>`).

- GETTSIM returns an object of the same type and with the same identifiers that was
  passed by the user.


.. _gep-2-aggregation-functions:

Aggregated values and aggregation functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often columns refer to units aggregating multiple individuals. Such columns have a
suffix indicating the level of aggregation (see :ref:`GEP 1 <gep-1-column-names>`,
currently ``_hh`` or ``_tu``). These columns' values will be repeated for all
individuals who a part of a unit.




Alternatives
------------

Versions 0.3 -- 0.4 (0.5) of GETTSIM used a collection of pandas Series. This proved
to be slow and cumbersome.

Adhering to normal forms (e.g., reducing the length of arrays to the number of
households like [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/segment_sum)
would have led to many merge-like operations in user functions.
