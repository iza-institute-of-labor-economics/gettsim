How To Maintain
===============

This document is dedicated to maintainers of GETTSIM.


Versioning
----------

GETTSIM adheres in large parts to `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_. Thus, for
a given version number ``major.minor.patch``

* ``major`` is incremented when you make incompatible API changes.
* ``minor`` is incremented when you add functionality which is backwards compatible.
* ``patch`` is incremented when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Branching Model
---------------

The branching model for GETTSIM is very simple.

1. New major and minor releases of GETTSIM are developed on the master branch.

2. For older major and minor releases there exist branches for maintenance called, for
   example, ``0.1`` or ``1.3``. These branches are used to develop new patch versions.

   Once a minor version will not be supported anymore, the maintenance branch should be
   deleted.


.. _releases:

How To Release
--------------

To release a new major or minor version of GETTSIM, do the following.

1. To start the release process for any new version, e.g., ``0.2``, first `create a new
   milestone
   <https://github.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/gettsim/milestones/new>`_  on
   Github. Set the name to the version number (format is ``v[major].[minor]``, in this
   example: ``v0.2``) to collect issues and PRs.

   A consensus among developers determines the scope of the new release. Note that
   setting up the milestone and determining the scope of the release will typically
   happen quite some time before the next steps.

2. Once all PRs in a milestone are closed:

   a. Update :ref:`changes` with all necessary information regarding the new release.

   b. Use ``bumpversion [major|minor|patch]`` to increment all version strings. For
      example, to bump the version from ``0.1.x`` to ```0.2.0``, type

      .. code-block:: bash

          $ bumpversion minor

   c. Merge it to the master branch and create a maintenance branch ``[major].[minor]``,
      i.e., ``0.2`` in this example.

3. The following step assigns a version and documents the release on Github. Go to the
   `page for releases <https://github.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/
   gettsim/releases>`_ and draft a new release. The tag and title become ``vx.y.z``.
   Make sure to target the master or maintenance branch. A long description is not
   necessary as the most important information is documented under :ref:`changes`.
   Release the new version by clicking "Publish release".

4. On your local machine, pull the latest changes to the repository, check out the new
   release tag and run

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ python release.py

   which uploads the new release to the `repository on Anaconda.org
   <https://anaconda.org/gettsim/gettsim>`_.


.. _backports:

How To Maintain Previously Released Versions
--------------------------------------------

Most changes to previously released versions come in the form of backports. Backporting
is the process of re-applying a change to future versions of GETTSIM to older versions.

As backports can introduce new regressions, the scope is limited to critical bug fixes
and documentation changes. Performance enhancements and new features are not backported.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

In the following we will consider an example where GETTSIM's stable version is
``0.2.0``. Version ``0.3.0`` is currently developed on the master branch. There is a
maintenance branch ``0.2`` to receive patches for the ``0.2.x`` line of releases. And a
critical bug was found, which should be fixed in both ``0.3.0`` and in ``0.2.1``.

1. Create a PR containing the bug fix which targets the master branch.
2. Add a note to the release notes for version 0.2.1.
3. Squash merge the PR into master and note down the commit sha.
4. Create a new PR against branch ``0.2``. Call the branch for the PR
   ``backport-pr[No.]-to-0.2.1`` where ``[No.]`` is the PR number.
5. Use ``git cherrypick -x <commit-sha>`` with the aforementioned commit sha to apply
   the fix to the branch. Solve any merge conflicts, etc..
6. Add the PR to the milestone for version ``0.2.1`` so that all changes for a new
   release can be collected.
7. The release process for a patch version works as above in :ref:`releases` to release
   ``0.2.1``; just that it is released off the maintenance branch, not off master.

FAQ
---

**Question**: I want to re-run the Azure Pipelines test suite because a merge to the
master branch failed due to some random error, e.g., a HTTP timeout error.

**Answer**: Go to
https://dev.azure.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/gettsim/_build. Make sure you are
signed in. First click on the build which merged the PR to master. On the ensuing page,
click on the button with the three vertical dots. Choose "Edit pipeline". Do not edit
the configuration, but select "Run" in the upper right corner.
