The function has no body because it is irrelevant for this guide. The function can be passed to `compute_taxes_and_transfers` alongside the `policy_functions` by placing both objects in a list."

    "Here is how you would call `compute_taxes_and_transfers`:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "1. Note that, `kindergeld_m_hh` has the same function name as a [pre-defined function](https://gettsim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gettsim_objects/functions.html#gettsim.functions.kindergeld_m_hh) inside gettsim. Thus, the internal function will be replaced with this version.\n",

    "2. In general, if there are multiple functions with the same name, internal functions have the lowest precedence. After that, the elements in the list passed to the `functions` argument are evaluated element by element. The leftmost element has the lowest precedence and the rightmost element the highest.\n",
