Specifically, this tutorial shows how to navigate the numerous [input and target](../gettsim_objects/input_variables.rst) variables that the package supports as well as how GETTSIM processes them internally using the example of child benefits in the German taxes and transfers system."

For instance, *Kindergeld* can be claimed as a monthly payment but also as a tax credit (*Kinderfreibetrag*) which is more advantageous for higher income groups. Additionally, eligibility depends on factors like the age and work status of children. These factors make it a more complex feature of the German taxes and transfers system than one might initially believe.  \n",
