    "# Changing Functions of the Taxes and Transfers System\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on the policy functions of GETTSIM. Alongside policy parameters, these functions help GETTSIM define a date-specific policy environment based on which it can compute taxes and transfers for individual and household data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like [parameters](parameters.ipynb), policy functions can be replaced, added or removed to make changes to the existing policy environment. This way, you can design a new tax or transfer for any specific group of people, e.g. invent a new tax for people that have income from renting an apartment, or change the conditions for receiving already existing transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showcases the policy functions using a concrete example. For a more comprehensive and abstract discussion of the feature, check out the [how-to guide on Different Ways to Load Policy Functions](../how_to_guides/different_ways_to_load_policy_functions.ipynb).\n"

    "\n",
    "In the German system, there are some transfers for low-income families that cannot be received in combination. Per default, GETTSIM will always choose the most favorable transfers and set other transfers to zero. This assumption could model the behavior of households/families in a wrong way, if they do not always choose the optimal transfers (from a monetary perspective). For example, there could be a social stigma connected to certain transfers or some people simply do not know about some of the available transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for these frictions, we can turn off this aspect of GETTSIM so that we see all the transfers a family/household is entitled to, even if the transfers cannot be received in combination. This can be useful for further analysis. For example you could speculate which transfers Germans receive in reality and implement this in GETTSIM.\n",
