    "This tutorial covers the basics of GETTSIM's interface to get you started with the package. GETTSIM enables an almost complete simulation of the German taxes and transfers system which makes it interesting for both students and researchers. Its extensive coverage of taxes and social policies in Germany makes it a valuable educational tool to learn about the current and past German policy environment. Simultaneously, GETTSIM's capabilities to process household data and compute according taxes and transfers make it a powerful tool that can be used for advanced microsimulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface consists of two central functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `set_up_policy_environment` which loads a policy environment for a specified date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `compute_taxes_and_transfers` which allows you to compute taxes and transfers given a specified policy environment for household or individual observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections give a brief introduction to these two functions using a minimal working example. The necessary packages and GETTSIM functions can be imported into your notebook as follows."

If only a year is specified, the policy date will be set to the first day of the year i.e. the inputs `\"2020\"` and `2020` will both return the policy environment for January 1st, 2020. The input `\"2020/03\"` on the other hand will set up the policy environment for March 1st, 2020 since a month and year are specified. Lastly, it is also possible to use a specific day such as `\"2020/03/21\"`, which will return the policy environment for March 21st, 2020."
