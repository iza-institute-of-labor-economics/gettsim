    Advance on Alimony Payment / Unterhaltsvorschuss (UHV)

    Single Parents get alimony payments for themselves and for their
    child from the ex partner. If the ex partner is not able to pay the child
    alimony, the government pays the child alimony to the mother (or the father, if
    he has the kids)

    The amount is specified in §1612a BGB and, ultimately, in Mindesunterhaltsverordnung.
