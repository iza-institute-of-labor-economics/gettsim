    The purpose of Kinderzuschlag (Kiz) is to keep families out of ALG2. If they would
    be eligible to ALG2 due to the fact that their claim rises because of their
    children, they can claim Kiz.

    A couple of criteria need to be met.

    1. the household has to have some income

    2. net income minus housing benefit needs has to be lower than total ALG2 need plus
       additional child benefit.

    3. Over a certain income threshold (which depends on housing costs, and is therefore
       household-specific), parental income is deducted from child benefit claim.

    In contrast to ALG2, Kiz considers only the rental costs that are attributed to the
    parents. This is done by some fixed share which is updated on annual basis
    ('jÃ¤hrlicher Existenzminimumsbericht')
