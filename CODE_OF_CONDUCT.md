# Code of Conduct (CoC)

The GETTSIM community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of
skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our
community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with
members of the community, this CoC will help steer your interactions and keep GETTSIM a
positive, successful, and growing community.

## Our Community

Members of the GETTSIM community are open, considerate, and respectful. Behaviours that
reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

- *Being open*. Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on
  feature requests, patches, problems, or otherwise.
- *Focusing on what is best for the community*. We're respectful of the processes set
  forth in the community, and we work within them.
- *Acknowledging time and effort*. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that
  permeate the GETTSIM community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of
  others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good
  of the community.
- *Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences*. We're receptive to
  constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other
  members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
- *Showing empathy towards other community members*. We're attentive in our
  communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching
  differing views.
- *Being considerate*. Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other
  GETTSIM users.
- *Being respectful*. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their
  commitments, and their efforts.
- *Gracefully accepting constructive criticism*. When we disagree, we are courteous in
  raising our issues.
- *Using welcoming and inclusive language*. We're accepting of all who wish to take part
  in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone
  can make a difference.

## Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The
GETTSIM community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone,
regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,

thereof), education, or socio-economic status.
